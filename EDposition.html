<h3>Position Description and Core Responsibilities</h3>

<a href="http://www.personalgenomes.org/organization/">PersonalGenomes.org</a>)

is seeking an energetic and experienced leader to sustain and develop our

organization, not just into a larger version of its current self, but into

one that will find new and more effective ways to support its mission.

<p>

Reporting to the Board of Directors, the Executive Director is responsible

for the programmatic and financial health and stability of the organization,

coalition builder, chief fundraiser and leader of OHF. They should be

responsibility for administration, program, budget, and fundraising. The

candidate will have expertise in user-engagement strategy and partnerships,

<h3>About Open Humans Foundation</h3>



<p>

The Open Humans Foundation supports the vision of humans having access to

their own data and sharing it at their own option with others for the

benefit of science and humanity.

</p>



<p>

OHF is a small and dynamic research and citizen participation organization

with an 8-year history of dramatic change from a nonprofit organization

created to support what began as a small, 10-participant public-genome

project (the Harvard Personal Genome Project) to a much broader platform

for citizen participation for data collection and sharing. We collect and

share microbiomes, trait data and other health data in addition to genomes.

Over the past eight years we have fostered the creation of the

<a href="http://www.personalgenomes.org/harvard/global-network">PGP Network</a>,

the <a href="http://www.getconference.org/">Genomes Environment Traits

Conference</a>, and the <a href="https://www.openhumans.org">Open Humans Project</a>.

</p>



<p>

The organization is now ready to scale, and is looking for an executive

director who can help us do so. We plan to reach a much broader

data-supplying public as well as more researchers. We intend to become an

even stronger voice advocating for user access to data with the option of

sharing it with researchers and/or the public at large, at their option.

</p>



<p>

The board of the Open Humans Foundation includes George Church, Misha

Angrist, John Cammack, Esther Dyson, Steven Keating, Michelle Meyer, Ryan

Phelan and Juan Enriquez.

</p>



<p>

OHF is committed to providing equal employment opportunity to qualified

persons without regard to race, sex, color, religion, national origin,

citizenship, marital status, sexual orientation, age, disability, military,

veteran status or any other protected status or classification under

federal, state or local law.

</p>



<hr>



<p><b>To Apply:</b></p>

<p>

Please submit a succinct cover letter in which you share

with us your vision of how the OHF can grow to be even more effective. We do

not expect you to have perfect knowledge of OHF, but we are interested in your

views of the needs and challenges in this space, and in how you believe that

OHF can uniquely contribute to open genotype-phenotype research data and

related goals. In addition, please submit your resume or c.v.

</p>

<p>

Please submit in PDF format (single document preferred but not required) to

<a href="mailto:ed-recruitment@openhumans.org">ed-recruitment@openhumans.org</a>,

with "Executive Director" and your name in the subject line. Kindly copy
